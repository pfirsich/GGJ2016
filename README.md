# Scavenger Hunt

Made for Global Game Jam 2016 (in Cologne).
In this game you play as two maniacs with compulsive tendencies, that, on their killing spree, require themselves to finish the job only through finishing other objectives. You play competitively and try to finish your list of tasks the fastest and without getting caught by authorities.

**ATTENTION**: Two controllers are required to play this game!
